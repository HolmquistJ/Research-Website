<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tidal wetlands produce long-term soil organic carbon (C) stocks. Thus for carbon accounting purposes, we need accurate and precise information on the magnitude and spatial distribution of those stocks. We assembled and analyzed an unprecedented soil core dataset, and tested three strategies for mapping carbon stocks: applying the average value from the synthesis to mapped tidal wetlands, applying models fit using empirical data and applied using soil, vegetation and salinity maps, and relying on independently generated soil carbon maps. Soil carbon stocks were far lower on average and varied less spatially and with depth than stocks calculated from available soils maps. Further, variation in carbon density was not well-predicted based on climate, salinity, vegetation, or soil classes. Instead, the assembled dataset showed that carbon density across the conterminous united states (CONUS) was normally distributed, with a predictable range of observations. We identified the simplest strategy, applying mean carbon density (27.0 kg C m<sup>−3</sup>), as the best performing strategy, and conservatively estimated that the top meter of CONUS tidal wetland soil contains 0.72 petagrams C. This strategy could provide standardization in CONUS tidal carbon accounting until such a time as modeling and mapping advancements can quantitatively improve accuracy and precision.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Coastal wetlands store carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and emit CO<sub>2</sub> and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) making them an important part of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventorying. In the contiguous United States CONUS), a coastal wetland inventory was recently calculated by combining maps of wetland type and change with soil, biomass, and CH<sub>4</sub> flux data from a literature review. We assess uncertainty in this developing carbon monitoring system to quantify confidence in the inventory process itself and to prioritize future research. We provide a value-added analysis by defining types and scales of uncertainty for assumptions, burial and emissions datasets, and wetland maps, simulating 10 000 iterations of a simplified version of the inventory, and performing a sensitivity analysis. Coastal wetlands were likely a source of net-CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) emissions from 2006–2011. Although stable estuarine wetlands were likely a CO<sub>2</sub>e sink, this effect was counteracted by catastrophic soil losses in the Gulf Coast, and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from tidal freshwater wetlands. The direction and magnitude of total CONUS CO<sub>2</sub>e flux were most sensitive to uncertainty in emissions and burial data, and assumptions about how to calculate the inventory. Critical data uncertainties included CH<sub>4</sub> emissions for stable freshwater wetlands and carbon burial rates for all coastal wetlands. Critical assumptions included the average depth of soil affected by erosion events, the method used to convert CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes to CO<sub>2</sub>e, and the fraction of carbon lost to the atmosphere following an erosion event. The inventory was relatively insensitive to mapping uncertainties. Future versions could be improved by collecting additional data, especially the depth affected by loss events, and by better mapping salinity and inundation gradients relevant to key GHG fluxes. Social Media Abstract: US coastal wetlands were a recent and uncertain source of greenhouse gasses because of CH<sub>4</sub> and erosion.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In the U.S., many former tidal wetlands have limited tidal connection with the sea, causing salinity to decline to the point where CH<sub>4</sub> emissions increase. Many wetlands drained for farming or other uses emit more CO<sub>2</sub> as soil decays and elevation is lost. We estimated the potential for reconnecting tidal flow to these tidal wetlands in order to avoid CH<sub>4</sub> emissions and reestablish soil carbon burial. For each coastal state in the contiguous U.S., we mapped natural, partially drained, impounded, and farmed wetlands falling within the range of intertidal elevation. We estimated all fluxes associated with soil carbon burial or loss, biomass change, and methane emission. We categorized each flux as either manageable or unmanageable, according to whether or not there is a direct restoration activity that might lower emissions or restart carbon burial. For all contiguous U.S. states, we mapped 0.66 million hectares of restorable wetlands, and we estimate 847 million tonnes of carbon are buried in the top 1 m of soil in natural wetlands. Of the manageable emissions, the vast majority come from the missed opportunity for carbon burial in partially drained coastal wetlands and wetlands converted to farmland. States with notable proportions of low elevation farmed areas include California and Washington. Partially drained wetlands are a prominent landcover type in North Carolina and New Jersey. States with relatively high proportions of low elevation impounded wetlands include California and Oregon. Future iterations of this analysis will include uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of the datasets and assumptions employed in order to establish levels of confidence and prioritize future research efforts. Future iterations will also include an assessment of the cost to benefit ratio of restoring wetlands from a carbon market perspective. The present results are a first cut establishing the scales and patterns of coastal restoration opportunities for coastal state-level stakeholders that seek to manage natural and working lands to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
